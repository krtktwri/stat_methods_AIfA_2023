In particular, it contains a sample of SDSS galaxies for which both photometric and spectroscopic measurements have been obtained. For all galaxies in this sample, we have access to photometrically-determined magnitudes $\\mathrm{mag}_u, \\mathrm{mag}_g, \\mathrm{mag}_r, \\mathrm{mag}_i, \\mathrm{mag}_z$ and spectroscopically-determined redshift $z$. We will use this sample to train a neural network to predict redshift $z$ from 5 input magnitudes $\\mathrm{mag}_u, \\mathrm{mag}_g, \\mathrm{mag}_r, \\mathrm{mag}_i, \\mathrm{mag}_z$, treating the spectroscopically determined redshift as ground truth.\n",
